        Html semantics tag is most useful for building layout and for  using better
        search engine optimization.

        Actually semantics in english means the meaning of any word.

        Here the semantics means that element with meaning.

        Now the element are inside our html,how can give them meaniing and how search 
        engines can be helped or those people who analyzed the website can be hepled and
        in term can be helped by them.

        Now what help will you take from then,as ifn you have your blog,you have put some 
        element on it.If you find a way to tell your SEO that is goole that I hav put
        tthis tag for navigation bar.I have put this tag for article,header,footer etc.

        Then what will happen,your website will be persed in a very good way by the perser
        through the SE and the ranking probability of your website being indexed and 
        rank will be by Google is very high.

        In previous day we used <div> tag to make website but that could not tell SEO
        it is header or footer or main etc.You can use to show this is navigation bar,
        For this we use semantics tag or making website layout in better way.
