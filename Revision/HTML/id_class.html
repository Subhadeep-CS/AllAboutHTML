    <!-- id and class are the part of the CSS but we are going to discuss here.
         When a child born we give name ,if you have to call someone then you can call
         him by his name for that's reason you need to name.

         Now,In html we will give a name,it's called id.Id means identifier which you
         can indentify by this name

         There can't be two people of one name.It's rule because we use id for uniquely
         identification.

         Why id is given to elememt?

         To uniquely identify when further you will write javascript or css at that time
         you will know:-with js you can target one elemnt,if you want to change inside 
         the element content,then you can grab this element with id,you can give css also

         Suppose my website has 100 elemnt.I want to give red color backgroud that 100 elemnts.
         I have two option

         1.for each element I can define style individually.That' repetive

         2.You will give a class of name red by All property you want to define inside redbg.
         I want to red background when I will give the class on element.In that element
         all those propertes will come,you can define multiple class on class tag.
