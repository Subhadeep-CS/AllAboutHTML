        Inline Element and Block Element

        <body>
            <p>This is para1</p>
            <p>This is para2</p>
        </body>

        Now if you run that html code then we see second para jumps on line2.Now
        I want them in the same line. Now the question is why it umps into second
        line? Here,the block elements comes into the picture.

        Paragraph is a block element.Block elements means it takes up the entire width
        like <div> tag.Any element that is next will be after it.
        
        If we add <span> tag then we see that this maintain same line because span tag
        is a inline element.It does not take 100% width.It's takes that width which is
        needed to display that content.
