        Every language follows a structure . Though HTML is a markup language so HTML also
        follow a document structure

        <!DOCTYPE html> ==> It's tell the web browser it's a HTML document.

        <html>==> HTML is the root element for the html page inside the html tag we 
        use a lang attribute, lang attribute specify the language of that document.

        Inside the html tag we have <head></head> tag and a <body></body> tag

        Let's deep drive into <head></head> tag

        <head></head> head tag contains the meta information and the <title></title>
        tag and some external sheets 

        <meta>=> Meta means information about information. Actually it's used for 
        search engine optimization, we will cover it later.

        <title></title>=> This tag is used to specify title of the webpage.Whatever text
        I put inside of the <title></title> that will show in browser title.

        Inside the <head></head> tag also we specify some external link to
        linking CSS file and Javascript file as per our requirement.
